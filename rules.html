    <p>
      Pac-Man, originally called Puck Man in Japan, is a 1980 maze video game
      developed and released by Namco for arcades. In North America, the game
      was released by Midway Manufacturing as part of its licensing agreement
      with Namco America. The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots
      inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large
      flashing dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn
      blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.
    </p>
    <h2 class="rules-heading">How to play?</h2>
    <p>
      When loading in the game, the user has the options to use the arrow keys
      or the wasd buttons to control pac-man. The goal is to eat as many pellets
      and ghosts (by eating the power-up pellet which is in a different color)
      and reach a score of at least 6000 points.
    </p>
